Real estate is the least transparent industry in our ecosystem. Housing prices keep changing day in and day out and sometimes are hyped rather than being based on valuation. Predicting housing prices with real factors is the main crux of our research project. Here we aim to make our evaluations based on every basic parameter that is considered while determining the price. We use various regression techniques in this pathway, and our results are not sole determination of one technique rather it is the weighted mean of various techniques to give most accurate results. The results proved that this approach yields minimum error and maximum accuracy than individual algorithms applied. We also propose to use real-time neighborhood details using Google maps to get exact real-world valuations.
